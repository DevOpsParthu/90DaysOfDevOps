# Day 16 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers.

## Docker

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

# Tasks

### As you have already installed Docker in previous days' tasks, now is the time to run Docker commands.

`sudo apt-get install docker.io -y && sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock`
